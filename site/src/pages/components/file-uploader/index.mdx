# File Uploader

File Uploader allows the user to transfer a file or submit content of their own. Either natively using a file input or drag and drop.

File Uploader shows the progress of the upload and provides feedback on the upload status.

## Best practices

- Always keep the file name visible.
- Provide information about file type, size, and upload speed or progress when possible.
