# File Uploader

File Uploader allows the user to transfer a file or submit content of their own. Either natively using a file input or drag and drop.

File Uploader shows the progress of the upload and provides feedback on the upload status.

## Best practices

- Always keep the file name visible.
- Provide information about file type, size, and upload speed or progress.

## File Uploader status

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width={160}>Loading</th>
      <td>Inform a user of the upload progress. Provide informations like file size and upload speed estimate.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Error</th>
      <td>Any errors that may occur with the file upload should appear as an Inline Error.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Complete</th>
      <td>
        When completed, the thumbnail will be shown in the list, and a success icon and Success message indicates the
        upload state.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Paused</th>
      <td>Only for big files. Let the user pause and unpause the upload.</td>
