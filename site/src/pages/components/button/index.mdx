# Button

Buttons express what action will occur when the user clicks it. Buttons are used to initialize an action, and some examples include actions like Add, Save, and Delete.

## Best practices

- Do not use Buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use **Links** because it takes the user to a new page and is not associated with an action.
- Button labels tell users what will happen when they click the button. Use verbs that describe the action, such as **Add** or **Delete**. Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized) and no more than three words for button labels.
- For Sets of Buttons, use specific labels, such as **Save** or **Discard**, instead of using **OK**. This is particularly helpful when the user is confirming an action.

## Button types

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th width={190}>Default</th>
      <td>When an action requires primary dominance on the page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Ghost button</th>
      <td>When an action does not require primary dominance on the page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Button with icon</th>
      <td>
        When words are not enough, icons can be used in buttons to better communicate what the button does. Icons are
        always paired with text.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Icon button</th>
      <td>Usually used associated with a dropdown menu, settings panel.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Disabled button</th>
      <td>Use when the user cannot proceed until an input is collected.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Danger button</th>
      <td>When an action has potentially destructive effects on the user's data (delete, remove, etc).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Set of buttons</th>
      <td>
        When an action required by the user has more than one option, always use a negative action button (secondary)
        paired with a positive action button (primary) in that order. Negative action buttons will be on the left.
        Positive action buttons should be on the right.
      </td>
    </tr>
