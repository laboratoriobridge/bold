# Date picker

Date components allow the user to make a specific selection through a visual calendar. By default, the calendar always displays the current month. If you already have a date entered, the calendar displays the month for that date.

## Best practices

- Use when the date selected is close to the actual date or for a period of less than 1 year.
- The user should be able to enter values also through the keyboard.
- Use placeholders to indicate the format of the data entry, for example: dd/mm/yyyy or mm/dd/yy, etc..
- The field should have only one input type, and should not be divided into fields for each information (day, month, year).

## Date picker types

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width={160}>Default</th>
    <td>When it's necessary to select one date.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Simple Date Picker</th>
    <td>
      Recommended when the user knows the date and does not need the calendar to anticipate the dates. Usually used on
      credit card expiration dates.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Range Date Picker</th>
    <td>Used to select a date range.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
