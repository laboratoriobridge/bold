# Breadcrumb

Breadcrumbs enable users to quickly see their location within a path of navigation and move up to a parent level if desired. 

## Best practices

- Place Breadcrumbs near the top of the page.
- Show hierarchy, not history.
- Keep Breadcrumb titles short but descriptive.
- Do not use a Breadcrumb if you are taking users through a multi-step process (use a Progress Indicator for this.)
- Use Breadcrumbs only if there are two or more navigation levels (ex.: Home > Settings).
